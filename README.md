sql 
This project demonstrates PL/SQL Collections (VARRAY, Nested Table, Associative Array),
Records, and a GOTO statement using a simple payroll system.

VARRAY = fixed list of salaries.
Nested Table = bonuses that can grow.
Associative Array = fast lookup of employee names.
Records = group employee info.
GOTO = skip invalid data (demo only).
